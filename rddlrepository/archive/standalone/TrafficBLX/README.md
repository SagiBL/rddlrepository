# A Guide for the BLXed

The goal of this document is to describe the BLX traffic model, as well as some of the subtle points of
its implementation in the RDDL language. The title is a play on ``A Guide for the Perplexed'',
a work of philosophy by Maimonides. The author apologizes for the pun, but it seemed too good to pass up :)

The rest of the document is structured as follows. The first section will describe the BLX model in general terms,
discuss the issue of how vehicle flow propagation is implemented in RDDL, and discuss linear blending. The
second section will discuss the difference between so-called ``Simple'' and ``Complex'' phasing schemes.
The final section will describe how to use the instance file generator to create a grid network and run
the instance as a RDDLEnv using pyRDDLGym.
